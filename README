DESCRIPTION
=========================================================================

The program will be able to read the data to be encrypted either from a file
specified on the command line or from stdin.
(data could either be typed in at the keyboard or stdin redirected from a file
 or via a pipe).
The encrypted data(binary data) will be written to stdout which can be
redirected to a file.

5 inputs needed are:

    - passPhrase (a string used to create cypto mask)
    - key1 (key1 used to create cypto mask)
    - key2 (key2 used to create cypto mask)
    - rotVal (the mask rotated according to rotVal)
    - FILE  (the FIle to be encrypted/decrypted)

=========================================================================
COMPILATION
=========================================================================
(Note: all command will be include in "" ,which means "" is not part of the
 command )

Compilation is made easy through the use of the Make utility. A file
included with the source called Makefile specifies how to derive the target
program.

How to compile
--------------------
To compile the program, simply navigate to the directory containing the
source file for PA0 and do the following in a Linux terminal:

    "make"

How to run
--------------------
To run the program after make has finished, type the following:

    "./pa2 [passPhrase] [key1] [key2] [rotVal] [FILE]"

(NOTICE: the output will on text console by default, but since the FILE is
 encrypted as binary file, it's better to redirect the output to a file and then
 use binary mode to check the content of the output file.)


Validation of inputs
--------------------
 [passPhrase]      >= 8 character long
 [key1      ]      must be numeric; decimal, octal or hexadecimal
 [key2      ]      must be numeric; decimal, octal or hexadecimal
 [rotVal    ]      must within range [-63,63], decimal format
 [FILE      ]      either a name of a file or '-' for stdin

(NOTE: passPhrase will only copy the first 8 characters when the string passed
 in is greater than 8 )

If any of the arguments is not validated, corresponding error messages will be
printed out on the standard output stream(text console), but the program won't
stop until it checked all arguments and print out all error messages if there
are any. The total number of error occurred will also be printed out.

========================================================================
SAMPLE OUTPUT
=========================================================================

An example of [ Valid Input ]
----------------------------------------
(The normal output goes to stdout.)

>>> Reading from file and redirecting to output file
[cs30xma@ieng9]:pa2$ ./pa2 cse30rules 12 123456 7 test1 > test2

>>> Piping to stdin and redirecting to output file
[cs30xma@ieng9]:pa2$ cat test1 | ./pa2 cse30rules 12 12 4 - > test2

>>> Using hexadecimal values for key1 and octal for key2
[cs30xma@ieng9]:pa2$ ./pa2 cse30rules 0x5f 054 12 test1 > test2

>>> Using a negative number for rotation value
[cs30xma@ieng9]:pa2$ ./pa2 cse30rules 0x32 013 -43 test1 > test2


Examples of [ Invalid Input ]
----------------------------------------
(The abnormal output goes to stderr.)

>>> Wrong number of arguments
[cs30xma@ieng9]:pa2$ ./pa2 cse30rules 4

Usage: ./pa2 passPhrase key1 key2 rotVal FILE
    passPhrase (must at least eight characters long)
    key1 (must be numeric; decimal, octal or hexadecimal)
    key2 (must be numeric; decimal, octal or hexadecimal)
    rotVal (must be a decimal value within the range [ -63 - 63])
    FILE (must be the name of a file or ' -' for stdin)

>>> Miscellaneous mistakes with input
[cs30xma@ieng9]:pa2$ ./pa2 cse30ru 43a 999999999999 79 sdfaa

    Passphrase must be at least 8 chars long

    "43a" is not an integer

    Converting "999999999999" base "0": Result too large

    Rotation key must be within the range of [ -63 <-> 63]

    sdfaa: No such file or directory

    --- Found 5 errors. ---


>>> Using hexadecimal value for rotation value
[cs30xma@ieng9]:pa2$ ./pa2 cse30rules 0xf 04556 0x4 test1 > test2

     "0x4" is not an integer
     --- Found 1 errors. ---


========================================================================
Testing
=========================================================================
This program was tested using the given pa2test executable.
I wrote a tester.sh, which will take arguments from the command line
and pass the same arguments to both pa2 and pa2test and their outputs were
redirected to two different files:

    pa2     >& test2
    pa2test >& stdtest2

These outputs were then compared using the command line tool "cmp -l".
When there were no differences in output, my shell file will just ouput done to
indicate there are no difference in two files.

=========================================================================
QUESTIONS
=========================================================================
(NOTE: command are included in "", which means "" is not part of command)
1. Q: What is the command to rename a file?

   A:  "mov [File_name] [File_new_name]"

        e.g. rename a.txt to test.txt
             "mov a.txt test.txt"

2. Q: What is the command to copy a file?

   A: "cp [source_file] [destination]"

       e.g. copy test from home to current directory
            "cp ~/test ."

3. Q: What happens when you select text and then middle click in the vim editor
   when in insert/input mode?

   A: the text you just select will be copied and after the middle clicking, the
   text that just got copied will be paste.

4. Q: What is a .vimrc file, and how do you create/edit them?

   A: The vimrc file contains optional runtime configuration settings to
      initialize Vim when it starts.

      To create it, simply "touch .vimrc" in ~/ directory in Unix system.

      to edit it, simply open ".vimrc" and write in some command will customize
      your vim environment. s.t.

      if you put "syntax on" in your ".vimrc" file, the key word in specific
      files (such as return in .java file) will have different color than other
      code.

5. Q: What is the command to cut a full line of text to the clipboard in vim?
   How do you paste it? 

   A: "dd" -- cut a full line
      "p"  -- paste the contents in the clipboard in vim


6. Q: How do you search for a string in vim?
   A: in normal mode, type "/" with search pattern, press <cr> to perform the
      search, then press "n" to search forward, "N" to search backwords

7. Q: How do you turn on line numbers in vim?
   A: in normal mode, type "set nu"

8. Q: How can you quickly (with a single Linux command) change directory to a
   directory named fubar that is in your home (login) directory? You cannot
   change directory to your home directory first and then change directory to
   fubar. That would take two commands. State how you would do this with a
   single command no matter where your current working directory might be.

   A: "cd ~/fubar"

9. Q: How do you change the permissions on a file? Let's say want to give read
   permission to the group? Specify the command to do this.

   A: "chmod g+r [filename]" will give read permission to the group on this
      specific file.


      e.g. if you want to give read the permission on file a.txt for the group,

           "chmod g+r a.txt"
